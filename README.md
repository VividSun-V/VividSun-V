We think everyone building web apps/sites should learn `CSS`.
However we agree that it can feel frustrating and often overwhelming.
Many software engineers/developers feel they already have enough to learn with the rest of their chosen "stack", so investing the time to perfect the interface design & layout feels like too much. We get it!
